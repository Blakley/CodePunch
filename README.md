# CodePunch
A Code typing Web App </br>
The premise of this project was to create a standard typing game. </br>
However, the excerpts that the user will type comes from solutions to
popular coding-interview practice problems. </br> All of which can be [found here.](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?listId=79h8rn6)
The code editor we use comes from `codemirror` which you can read more about [here.](https://codemirror.net/)

## Features

* Code highlighting using codemirror as our input form
* Custom calculated typing average (WPM)

### Todo:
  - Use cookies to store users wpm for completed problems
  - Implement other langauges (current only c#)
